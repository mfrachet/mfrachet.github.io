Guarantee that something is not visually visible and does not cause layout problems but still make the content available for assistive technologies (+ explanations on the impact of other CSS technics).

```css
.opacity {
  opacity: 0; /* computed in layout, exist in accessibility tree */
}

.display-none {
  display: none; /* not computed  in layout nor in accessibility tree */
}

.hidden {
  visibility: hidden; /* computed in layout, not in accessibility tree */
}

/* exist in layout but doesn't take space, exist in accessibility tree  */
.visually-hidden {
  border: 0;
  clip: rect(0 0 0 0);
  height: 1px;
  margin: -1px;
  overflow: hidden;
  padding: 0;
  position: absolute;
  width: 1px;
}
```
