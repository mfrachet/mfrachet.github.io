This tricks comes from [Josh W Comeau](https://twitter.com/JoshWComeau) and is detailed in [The Quest for the Perfect Dark Mode](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/dark-mode/).

The problem solved is: **how to avoid the first flash when resolving a theme from the local storage on first load?**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Title of the page</title>

    <script>
      // This script is blocking and the document won't be shown
      // unless this script has finished its job. It's
      // the perfect place to resolve the theme from
      // local storage and play with it
      var DarkTheme = {
        text: "white",
        background: "black",
      };

      var LightTheme = {
        text: "black",
        background: "white",
      };

      var actualTheme = window.localStorage.getItem("theme") || "dark";
      var theme = actualTheme === "light" ? LightTheme : DarkTheme;

      var root = window.document.documentElement;
      root.style.setProperty("--color-text", theme.text);
      root.style.setProperty("--color-text", theme.background);

      // But we can't use document.querySelector or rely on other magic
      // because the browser has not finished processing the whole document
    </script>
  </head>

  <body>
    Content of the website
  </body>

  <script>
    // however, when reaching this script, "actualTheme" is resolved,
    // so is "document" and we have access to the whole document.
    // This is usuallywhere frontend frameworks loads
    // and hydrates the document.
    console.log("The theme is", actualTheme);
  </script>
</html>
```
