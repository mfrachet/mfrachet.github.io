When dealing with `onKeyDown` event, make sure to rely on the `e.key` attribute and compare it to the following.

```js
export const KeyboardKeys = {
  DOWN: "ArrowDown",
  UP: "ArrowUp",
  RIGHT: "ArrowRight",
  LEFT: "ArrowLeft",
  ESCAPE: "Escape",
  ENTER: "Enter",
  SPACE: " ",
  TAB: "Tab",
  END: "End",
  HOME: "Home",
  DELETE: "Delete",
  PAGE_UP: "PageUp",
  PAGE_DOWN: "PageDown",
  BACKSPACE: "Backspace",
  CLEAR: "Clear",
};
```
