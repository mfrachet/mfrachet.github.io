One way (it may exist other ways, and if you know about them, I will be more than happy to hear from that) to get the Cypress chromium based browsers port. It's the trick I use in [cypress-audit](https://github.com/mfrachet/cypress-audit).

```js
module.exports = (on, config) => {
  on("before:browser:launch", (browser = {}, launchOptions) => {
    const remoteDebuggingPort = launchOptions.args.find((config) =>
      config.includes("--remote-debugging-port=")
    );

    if (remoteDebuggingPort) {
      const port = remoteDebuggingPort.split("=")[1];
    }
  });
};
```
