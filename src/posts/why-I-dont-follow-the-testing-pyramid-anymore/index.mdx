_This post mostly target frontend development since I don't have that much knowledge on the backend side of apps._

The testing pyramid shows 3 layers of tests: "unit", "integration" and "end to end". Each layer does not have the same size: it gives an idea about the amount of tests that should be written. For instance, it illustrates that an application may have way more unit tests (which is a the bottom of the pyramid) than end to end tests (which is at the top of the pyramid). Also, the higher in the pyramid the test is, the slower it is to run and the more it costs.

The pyramid categorizes the tests we write.

Depending on the team people are working with, a test category definition may not be exactly the same. For instance, what is the difference between an integration test and a unit test in the context of React components? From my experience, the answer varies widely.

	- getting confidence
	- implementing a feature following the rules we have
