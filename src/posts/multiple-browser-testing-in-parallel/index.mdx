_A bunch of context will be given before providing the solution. Feel free to skip to the solution section._


## The story

My current side project is called [Progressively](https://github.com/mfrachet/progressively), and it aims to be a very simple, with lightweight client side SDKs and with an accessible dashboard,  **feature flag solution**.

A feature flag solution is a tool that allows to toggle a feature on and off, at runtime, based on some criterias.

For example, with such tools, it's possible to say:

> Hey, activate the new homepage for the user with an email containing "@progressively.app"

This is pretty practical for testing a feature on a small bunch of users before making the official release or before gradually rolling it out.

As mentioned before, it's practical to be able to target users, and in order to specifically target users we need information: a user id, a user email, or anything that allows to isolate people.

But what if I want to rollout a feature to 25% of my audience, BUT some people in my audience are NOT authenticated (or have not provided data that I could rely on to create a practical targeting)?

It exist solutions to fix this problem (using a hash function with a good distribution and storing the hash locally in the browser), but in order to acquire a good amount of confidence, I wanted to write automated tests
that would allow me to make assumptions based on a (customizable) pool of users.

So here's the situation, I want to write automated tests that could look like:

- start N browsers
- toggle a feature impacting M percent of the browsers 
- asserting that these M browsers see the activated variant
- asserting that the (N-M) browers see the NOT activated variant

## Why it's a problem?

The biggest problem regarding what I want to achieve, using regular tools like Cypress or Jest, is the incapacity to trigger **one** action impacting **multiple** browsers in parallel and make **one** assertion after that.

For instance, using Cypress, I'm not able to start 30 instances of chrome and make assertions on them. When I write the following test, it runs in one dedicated instance Chrome:

```js
// only runs in one dedicated browser, no possibility to run 10 instances and then make assertions.
it('verifies something', () => {
  cy.contain('Hello world').should('be.visible')
})
```

## How to solve this problem?

One solution to solve this problem would be to have a tool allowing to make assertions in the same way as the following pseudo-code:

```js
BROWSER_COUNT = 100;

startBrowsers(BROWSER_COUNT);          // start BROWSER_COUNT browsers
toggleFeatureFlag(25 / BROWSER_COUNT); // target 25% of the user pool
assertActivatedVariant(25)             // verify that ~25 (plus or minus) browser received the activated variant
assertNotActivatedVariant(75)          // verify that ~75 (plus or minus) browser received the NOT activated variant
```
